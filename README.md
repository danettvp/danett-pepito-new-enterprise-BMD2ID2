# Sorta

## Project Overview

Sorta is a new enterprise that introduces a smart food bin system with AI-powered weight and food scrap tracking, paired with a mobile-first app. This is app is designed to encourage students in New Zealand to properly use their food scrap bins.  It helps users log what they throw away, get personalised tips based on their habits, and see the impact of their actions over time.

## Problem & Inspiration

Many young adults in Auckland living independently don‚Äôt use the food scrap bins provided to them despite paying the yearly fee. Though they are environmentally aware of the consequences of their actions, some still don‚Äôt know how to use the bins, while others feel like their individual efforts don‚Äôt matter. This app was created to:

- Make food bin usage easier and faster  
- Help users get value from the waste services they‚Äôre already paying for
- Encourage small, sustainable habits in daily life
- Show that small individual actions can lead to meaningful environmental impact
