# Sorta

## Project Overview

Sorta is a new enterprise that introduces a smart food bin system with AI-powered weight and food scrap tracking, paired with a mobile-first app. This is app is designed to encourage students in New Zealand to properly use their food scrap bins.  It helps users log what they throw away, get personalised tips based on their habits, and see the impact of their actions over time.

## Problem & Inspiration

Many young adults in Auckland living independently don’t use the food scrap bins provided to them despite paying the yearly fee. Though they are environmentally aware of the consequences of their actions, some still don’t know how to use the bins, while others feel like their individual efforts don’t matter. This app was created to:

- Track what users throw away and shows the impact over time
- Encourage small, sustainable habits in daily life
- Offer personalised tips based on habits and what’s being logged

## Key Features / User Flows

- **Dashboard/Impact Tracker**  
  Displays a summary of how much food waste users have diverted from landfill. Users can click on arrows to go to another page.

- **Smart Tips**  
  Based on identified food tracking entries, the app provides helpful tips on reducing waste and sorting properly.

- **History**  
  Can view a list of items that were logged by the bin.

- **Last Scan**  
  From the homepage, users can see the last identified scan, from which they are able to manually input/log items if needed with the *Quick Logging Form*. This is where the database is. 

- **Quick Logging Form**  
  Users can input what they’re disposing of, categorise it, and log it manually. Users are able to view this log in a separate page when click 'View Logged Items'.
